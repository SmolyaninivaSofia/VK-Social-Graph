# VK-Social-Graph
Repository for Graph Analysis and Social Networks Assignment

## Abstract

Community detection is an important area in Social Networks Analysis. Research has shown that discovering the structure of the social network and detecting communities can be used in sociology, biology and computer science because systems are often represented as graphs. Nowadays, the most popular social networks like Facebook have a huge size and reach billions of nodes and the complexity of  this task is growing. 

This study aims to determine which groups are present in my VKontakte social network graph. Building on existing work on analysis of the VKontakte social network, the article answers: How to get relevant data from VK API and visualize this data? In this context, data means the tree of the friends and their respective friends for a specific user.

The main goal of this paper is to give a comprehensive description of the community detection algorithm for VK social graphs. For this I provide a python language code to extract the data from VK API and convert it to a .gexf file format. In addition, I used the Gephi tool to visualize the communities and relations between people. Finally, I provide further research directions as well as some open challenges.
